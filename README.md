# Sorting Analysis Project 📊



<p align="center">A comprehensive tool to analyze and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms. This project evaluates the time complexity and step count of popular sorting techniques on randomly generated data, providing valuable insights for algorithm selection.</p>



## 💫 Features

### 🔄 Multiple Sorting Algorithms

Analyze the performance of six classic sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each algorithm is implemented to sort an array of randomly generated integers.

### ⏱️ Time Measurement

Measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm with precision. The project uses the `clock()` function to calculate the time taken (in seconds) for each algorithm to sort the data, allowing for direct performance comparisons.

### 🧮 Step Counting

Track the number of steps (operations) performed by each sorting algorithm. A detailed step count is provided for every algorithm, offering insight into their computational efficiency beyond just runtime.

### 📈 Random Data Generation

Generate random datasets for consistent testing. The project includes a function to create an array of random integers, ensuring fair and repeatable comparisons across all sorting algorithms.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:**
  - C++
- **Libraries:**
  - Standard Template Library (STL) for I/O and time functions
